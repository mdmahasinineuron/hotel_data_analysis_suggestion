Business Problem:
A multinational hotel Company which operates their hotel business in 175 countries. They have two type of hotel 
1) City Hotel: - Hotel which located is within a city.
2) Resort Hotel: - Which is usually located near tourist point, beach, and hills
Hotel industry work on ‘Booking-Waiting-Reservation and cancellation system’. The more Booking-Waiting-Reservation
will get more profit for hotels. And more the cancellation will be done more the losses for hotels because the room
confirmed for that booking will not be able to assign to another booking. In recent days our client is getting more cancellation,
so it effects their revenue. We need to find the reason for high cancellation rate and give some solutions to reduce it.
